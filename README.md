# RoomMate
🚀 Project Overview
RoommateHub is a dynamic, full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of finding and listing shared living spaces or hotels. Developed using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js), this platform provides a seamless bridge between property owners and seekers. The application emphasizes a clean user experience, robust data management, and secure interaction, making it an ideal solution for modern housing needs.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for dynamic templating.

Styling: Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-first, responsive grid layout.

Backend: Node.js with the Express.js framework for efficient server-side logic.

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM for flexible, document-based data storage.

Authentication: Session-based login/signup logic for secure user access.

✨ Key Features
User Authentication & Authorization: A secure entry system where users can create accounts and log in. The app distinguishes between guests and registered users, ensuring that only authenticated individuals can create listings or post reviews.

Listing Management (CRUD): Users can fully manage their property listings. This includes creating new entries, uploading detailed descriptions of hotels or rooms, and viewing a comprehensive gallery of available places.

Interactive Review System: To foster trust within the community, the platform features a dedicated review module. Users can share their experiences and rate locations, providing valuable feedback for future tenants.

Responsive UI: Leveraging Bootstrap’s utility classes, the interface is fully optimized for all devices, from high-resolution desktops to mobile screens.

Data Persistence: Utilizing MongoDB, all user profiles, property descriptions, and reviews are stored securely, ensuring fast retrieval and high availability.

🎯 Project Goal
The primary objective of this project was to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in a real-world scenario. By separating data logic (Models), UI templates (Views), and routing logic (Controllers), the application remains scalable and easy to maintain.
